I'm just starting to write the documentation on this.

Note that **bashsteps** is good for some types of scripts, not good
for others.  And there are a bunch of scripts in between for which it
is experimental.  If you are considering using bashsteps (or forced to
use bashsteps), you should **discuss directly with me** about whether
to use it and how to get the most out of it.

An introduction that focuses on motivation is now at
[./doc/intro-to-core.md](./doc/intro-to-core.md).  It keeps the
discussion to the parts of bashsteps that are stable.

An example that exercises the core is at
[./examples/new/with-temporary-state.sh](./examples/new/with-temporary-state.sh).
Probably the next step in documentation is to annotate this example
and show how to give a demo with it.

Also there are comments in [./bashctrl.sh](./bashctrl.sh) and
[./simple-defaults-for-bashsteps.source](./simple-defaults-for-bashsteps.source)
that may give useful hints.
